# SCQN-Scanner-App
This application is a scanner application that uses the HMS Scan Kit technology. The use of the application is quite simple, the user only needs to point the camera at the object of the QR code, barcode, or other formats. When the camera manages to capture an image, the user will automatically be given the option to copy the results of the scan or open it in a browser. In addition to Scan Kit, we also use banner ads provided by Ads Kit.
